    This ViewSet is partly responsible for password *reset* flow, in
    other words, account recovery, in case the user forgets their
    password. The password change flow is different and not handled
    here.

    The three-step mechanism used in this flow is very similar to
    registration flow. Check out 'RegistrationViewSet' to learn
    about it.

    The only difference is, instead of asking user profile
    information, we just ask for the new password.

    The actual password change endpoint is located in 'reset_password'
    action of 'UserViewSet'.

    TODO: Should consider revoking other active tokens when password
     gets changed.
