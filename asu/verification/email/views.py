    This ViewSet is responsible for e-email change flow, in which the

    is done in 'create' action). Once they confirm the code using the
    'check' action, their email is changed.

    This flow does not require consent since it only entails two steps:
    'send' & 'verify' the code. There is no interim step such as in
    registration, where the user fills out profile information or in
    password reset, we ask for new password.
